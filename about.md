Hello! My name is Yibai Meng 孟逸白. I am a undergraduate student of [Peking University](www.pku.edu.cn), majoring in [electrical engineering](eecs.pku.edu.cn). I enjoy physics and computering science, especially tinkering with Linux.

I started this blog in October, 2017, as a place to document my technical studies. When I do some interesting stuff, I'll put it up here. Some time I'll write in Chinese, other times in English. Writing Markdown in Chinese is a hell of a nusiance, as I have to switch language mode a lot to input all these control sequences, so I'll only write in Chinese when in a good mood. Hope you'll find my notes interesting!

Write to me if you find anything wrong with my writings. My [email](mailto:mengyibai@pku.edu.cn) is mengyibai@pku.edu.cn. Or make a [pull request](https://github.com/YibaiMeng/yibaimeng.github.io), if you are a bit more impatient.

This blog is created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a framework for quickly creating static websites. It's hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com), a free hosting service(by GitHub of course). I edit my posts in Markdown, using [Atom](https://atom.io), another open source software by GitHub, on my [XiaoMi](https://www.mi.com) laptop. It's powered by electricity, provided by [States Gird](http://www.sgcc.com.cn/), generated on a powerplant somewhere in Hebei, China. Meanwhile, I am powered by food provided by [PKU cantering service](http://cyzx.pku.edu.cn/tzgg/48971.htm), with rice grown in the Northeast provinces, soy beans in Argentina, milk from New Zealand---wait, I've gotten too far, haven't I?
